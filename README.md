# .files
These are my dotfiles for configuring the
[Arch Linux distribution](https://archlinux.org/). 
The dot files configure the desktop environment, my terminal theme and 
shortkeys, my keyboard settings, my LaTeX write up workflow, and many
other useful settings.

The most straightforward manner to implement them --if you're
not already on Arch --is to install [Manjaro i3](https://manjaro.org/download/).
Once that is up and working, then clone my dotfiles to 
your home directory.

## Instructions to clone

Start your terminal --on i3, the shortcut is `<mod+CR>` i.e. your mod key
(usually left windows key) + enter, simultaneously. 

Next, enter these commands:

```
yay -S git
y
cd
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/henrysheehy/dotfiles.git
git pull origin master
```

1. The first command installs git, a version control system i.e. for
systematically sharing work; the second command confirms installation.
2. `cd` navigates to home directory, wherein we want to install our 
dot files.
3. Initialise the git repository.
4. Add my URL
5. Pull the branch i.e. download the files

## AUR and Python backup
Run `INSTALL.sh` to install my programmes from the [Arch Linux User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/) and [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

### What's in here? 
- Alacritty is a terminal emulator
- Autokey with my dotfiles transforms `hjkl` to arrow keys, or shift
arrow keys when ctrl is held simultaneously
- Caffeine to prevent sleep during full screen
- Fcitx language input
- Flameshot screen grab
- i3 and i3 polybar (personal configuration)
- Inkscape for LaTeX figures
- [Inkscape-LaTeX integration](https://github.com/gillescastel/inkscape-figures) by [Gilles Catel ‚úù2022](https://castel.dev/)
- Luavim built up from a foundation of [dotfiles](https://github.com/ejmastnak/dotfiles/) by [Elijan J. Mastnak](https://www.ejmastnak.com/)

## Keyboard
In order to use my keyboard (English, Greek, Chinese 
(Pinyin), Russian (phonetic), please run `keyboard.sh`
for the first time, and if the .keyboard configuration
is modified.

To use the languages
- Hold left-alt for Greek via XKB.
- Press right-windows key for Russian via XKB.
- Ctrl+spacebar for Chinese via Fcitx.

## To-do
- Fix autokey for input areas, such as dmenu
- Fix [inkscape-shortcut-manager](https://github.com/gillescastel/inkscape-shortcut-manager) bugs and push it the AUR as a package.
