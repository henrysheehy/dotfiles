## Instructions

The most straightforward manner to implement them --if you're
not already on [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) --is to install [Manjaro i3](https://manjaro.org/download/).
Once that is up and working, then clone my dotfiles to 
your home directory.

### Cloning the repository

Start your terminal --on i3, the shortcut is `<mod+CR>` i.e. your mod key
(usually left windows key) + enter, simultaneously. 

Next, enter these commands in order, pressing enter at the end of every line:

```
yay -S git
y
cd
git init
rm .Xresources .bashrc .config/i3/config
git remote add origin https://github.com/henrysheehy/dotfiles.git
git pull origin master
```

1. The first command installs git, a version control system i.e. for
   systematically sharing work; the second command confirms installation.
2. `cd` navigates to home directory, wherein we want to install our 
   dot files.
3. Initialise the git repository.
4. Add my URL
5. Pull the branch i.e. download the files

### Install my programmes
1. Update the local [Arch Linux User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/) with
   `yay -Syu`.
   This will also update your programmes and kernel.
2. Run `sh Scripts/INSTALL.sh` to install my programmes from the AUR and [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

#### Vim plugins
In order to install the plugins when using Vim for the first time, 
type `:PlugInstall` in an instance of Vim open Vim by entering `v my_first_file.md`. This will create a file with the given name in your current working directory (cwd).

### Keyboard
In order to use my keyboard (English, Greek, Chinese 
(Pinyin), Russian (phonetic), please run `keyboard.sh`
for the first time, and if the .keyboard configuration
is modified.

To use the languages
- Hold left-alt for Greek via XKB.
- Press right-windows key for Russian via XKB.
- Ctrl+spacebar for Chinese via Fcitx.

### Firfox plugins

#### Zotero

1. [Install the Zotero connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/)
2. Install [Better BibTex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/)
3. Configure shortcut for adding Zotero citation:Open `about:addons` in a Firefox tab.
    3.1. Press the wheel
    3.2. Zotero Connector: Ctrl+Shift+F

Open Zotero using i3 with `<mod+z>`. You can now 
add citations from Firfox to the currently open Zotero folder.

### Wallpaper

Simply make a wallpaper folder `mkdir Wallpaper` in the home
directory (`cd`, if you're not there already).
Add your favourite pictures üòÉ
To randomly cycle wallpaper, restart i3 with `mod+R`.
